## What is Astrology 

>Astrology is a pseudoscience that claims to divine information about human affairs and terrestrial events by studying the movements and relative positions of celestial objects.

## Goals For the App

Most people know their sun signm and a little more know their Moon sign and how it interacts with each other, but therre are many more connections that need to be discected to get a clear picture on how things work. Instead of striping away the Astrology names, like other apps, I want to help people correlate with what the sign is and what it is actually doing for them so when they hear something like "Mercury is in retrograde." they'll know what that exactly means related to them.

## To-Do's

Eeverything! Under Heavy Construction.
